# Contact Me

You can contact me at my email [me@ramesh.tv](mailto:me@ramesh.tv). If other means of contact are required, please e-mail me first since
it is easier for me to organize such things. My phone number and direct messaging/social media accounts are available upon request.

If you have questions about my projects or my blog, please feel free to reach out! I am happy to answer and talk with you. If you are a potential employer,
my résumé is also available upon request. 

I look forward to talking with you!
