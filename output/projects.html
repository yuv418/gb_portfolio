        <h1>Projects</h1>
<p>Here's a list of recent (semi-noteworthy) programming projects that I've worked on (everything else is available on GitHub/GitLab):</p>
<p><strong>vGPU Streaming</strong>: Currently I'm working on code that captures the buffer of an NVIDIA vGPU running in a KVM virtual machine and streams the buffer over the network by encoding the buffer into a video stream, hopefully eventually allowing a remote desktop servers that runs on the host instead of the guest. If I succeed, I plan to generalize my approach into a general multiplatform remote desktop protocol. So far I've successfully captured the frame and prepared it for encoding, using the libav* family of libraries.</p>
<p><strong>MQA Player (finished)</strong>: I used a shared library for a DAC that was an armv7 machine running embedded Linux and existing code that called aforementioned library, but expanded on it to make an IPC system to decode MQA on-the-fly from an x86 executable, which involved implementing my own mutexes and semaphores and learning how to use shared memory.</p>
<p><strong>emotes-rs</strong>: When you chat on Discord and paste the link to an image, Discord will remove the link and you'll only see the image. I thought it would be cool if you come up with memorable URLs that return images that are the size of emojis, allowing you send custom &quot;emojis&quot; in Discord. The Rust backend I wrote exposes a GraphQL API (using the wonderful async-graphql library) to manage users and uploading emotes, that uses SQLx to communicate to a PostgreSQL database. It also utilizes libvips to resize images quickly (resizing GIF emotes can be quite expensive and this library is exceedingly performant). I also wrote a version of this application in Python which was somewhat more featured, but it became impossible to maintain since I used too many niche libraries that were poorly documented. A frontend for emotes-rs is also available here.</p>
