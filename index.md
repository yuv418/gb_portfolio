# Hi, I'm Ramesh.

 I'm an aspiring software developer that's a first year student majoring in computer science at Rutgers University. I primarily prefer lower-level projects, with my preferred programming languages being C and Rust, but I also have extensive experience in many other programming languages and computer technologies (contact me for my résumé for additional information). Other than programming, I enjoy writing stories, and I also "maintain" a blog that tries to document technical (and sometimes non-technical) things that I find interesting. I also enjoy reading books, photography, and sometimes aimlessly thinking about the world. My favourite book series is the Stormlight Archive. You should read it too. 
 
Please feel free to check out the links in the header to learn more about me and my projects/experience.
